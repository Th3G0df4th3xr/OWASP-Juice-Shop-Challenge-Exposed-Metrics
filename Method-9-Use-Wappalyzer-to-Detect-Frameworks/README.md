üìò README: Method 9 ‚Äì Use Wappalyzer to Detect Frameworks
üéØ Objective:
Leverage Wappalyzer to fingerprint the front-end and back-end frameworks, JavaScript libraries, server technologies, and analytics services used by a target application. This can provide critical context about the attack surface and reveal weaknesses associated with specific technologies (e.g., outdated WordPress, vulnerable jQuery).

üß† Why This Method?
Understanding the technology stack of a web application allows an attacker or security researcher to tailor exploitation methods to specific known vulnerabilities. For example:

If Wappalyzer reveals Apache 2.4.49, you may research CVEs affecting that version (e.g., CVE-2021-41773).

If it detects AngularJS 1.x, you may test for client-side template injection (CSTI).

This reconnaissance method falls under passive enumeration with optional active probing, depending on usage.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools Required:
Wappalyzer Browser Extension (GUI approach)

Wappalyzer CLI or Python wrapper (for automation/offensive scripting)

Burp Suite (optional) to correlate HTTP headers or fingerprint data

üõ†Ô∏è Installation (CLI mode - optional for automation):
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer.git
cd wappalyzer
npm install
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g puppeteer
Or install Wappalyzer CLI globally:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g wappalyzer
üß™ Step-by-Step Execution (Browser Method ‚Äì GUI):
1. Install Extension:
Go to Wappalyzer Chrome Extension

Click Add to Chrome ‚Üí Add Extension

2. Navigate to Target Application:
Launch target URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for Juice Shop)

3. Trigger Page Load Events:
Click through the site (Login, Products, etc.) to ensure all scripts are loaded

Wappalyzer parses HTTP headers, script tags, and cookies dynamically

4. Click the Wappalyzer Icon:
View a categorized list of technologies:

Web Frameworks: Express.js, Angular

Programming Languages: Node.js

CDNs/JS Libraries: jQuery, Bootstrap

Analytics: Google Tag Manager

Server Info: Nginx, Apache

üìú Behind the Scenes (Technical Breakdown):
Wappalyzer works by analyzing:

HTTP response headers (e.g., X-Powered-By, Server)

Script src links (e.g., jquery.min.js, angular.js)

DOM patterns (e.g., presence of ng-app attribute)

Cookies (e.g., _ga, _gid ‚Üí Google Analytics)

Inline JS clues (e.g., certain JS functions or structure)

It uses a large regular-expression-powered signature database to match known technology fingerprints.

üí• CLI/Automated Use:
bash
Copy
Edit
wappalyzer https://example.com
You‚Äôll get structured JSON output like:

json
Copy
Edit

```
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "applications": [
    {
      "name": "Apache",
      "version": "2.4.49",
      "confidence": "100",
      "categories": ["Web Servers"]
    },
    {
      "name": "jQuery",
      "version": "1.12.4",
      "categories": ["JavaScript Frameworks"]
    }
  ]
}
```

üéØ Why This Helps in Offense:
Knowing the stack helps:

Prioritize vulnerability scanning

Pick tailored payloads (CSTI for Angular, DOM XSS for jQuery)

Check CVE/NVD databases for tech-specific flaws

Identify attack vectors (e.g., APIs in Express apps)

# TODO - Direct Metrics Access via Known Paths

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Identify and exploit unauthenticated access to sensitive metrics endpoints commonly exposed by web applications (e.g., `/metrics`, `/actuator`, `/actuator/metrics`) using direct HTTP request techniques.

---

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Instructions

### [ ] 1. Understand the Target Application Architecture
- **Why?** Juice Shop is a Node.js-based web application; depending on deployment configuration, it may expose debug, telemetry, or monitoring endpoints.
- **How?** These endpoints are often used by Prometheus, Spring Boot Actuator, or Node monitoring modules like `express-prom-bundle`.

---

### [ ] 2. Launch the OWASP Juice Shop Container
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name juice-shop bkimminich/juice-shop
Whatâ€™s Happening? This spins up a local Docker container exposing Juice Shop on localhost:3000.

Expected Output: A container ID and a running service accessible via browser or terminal at http://localhost:3000.

[ ] 3. Probe for Common Metrics Endpoints Using curl
bash
Copy
Edit
curl -I http://localhost:3000/metrics
curl -I http://localhost:3000/actuator
curl -I http://localhost:3000/actuator/metrics
Explanation:

-I fetches only HTTP headers to detect existence.

These endpoints are often hardcoded in Java Spring Boot or Node telemetry setups.

Expected Result: HTTP/1.1 200 OK if accessible; 404 or 403 otherwise.

Back-End Mechanism: The app might be exposing Prometheus metrics or JSON data due to a misconfigured monitoring setup.

[ ] 4. Investigate Response Body for /metrics or Similar
bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics
What to Look For:

Key-value telemetry (http_requests_total, memory usage, garbage collection stats).

Indicators like stack trace leaks, internal IPs, or service version headers.

[ ] 5. Analyze Security Implication
Why This Works: Developers leave /metrics or /actuator unprotected during dev or staging and forget to restrict in production.

Impact:

Disclosure of sensitive performance counters or service internals.

Potential for chaining with SSRF or alert fatigue attacks.

Attackers can use metrics to fingerprint the app and find time-based anomalies.

[ ] 6. Document Evidence
Take screenshots of the terminal.

Save response body:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics > metrics_exposed.txt
ðŸ’¡ Notes
This method is highly effective when:

No authentication is enforced.

DevOps teams forget to implement middleware-based auth guards.

WAF or reverse proxies are not filtering internal debug paths.

Consider running nmap with --script http-enum for other exposed endpoints.

ðŸ”’ Remediation Strategy
Use allowlists in reverse proxies or ingress gateways.

Enforce authentication on all debug or monitoring endpoints.

Regularly audit route exposure using dynamic application security testing (DAST).
